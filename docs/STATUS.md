# Project Status

Updated: 2026-08-21

This document is the implementation ledger for the repository-owned MIT
Provider Contract. It distinguishes local component evidence, Contract
projection evidence, CI, Conformance, external-caller compatibility,
multi-controller reliability, multi-tenant security, deployment, and
production readiness.

The lock verifier is intentionally bound to the repository-owned Contract tree.
It does not clone, mount, or read an external source repository.

## Evidence Boundary

PR #17 merged the repository-owned Contract migration and its post-merge CI
run `32360376058` passed all required jobs. PR #18 then merged the protected-
admission Contract resources and bindings as `4774c3a`; post-merge run
`32363581638` passed `provider-contract`, `test`, and `docker-integration`.
PR #19 merged the local Suite runner and CI invocation as `e2755f5`; post-merge
run `32365284283` passed all required jobs.

- local Go tests are component evidence only;
- the local Contract verifier proves lock/resource identity, not protocol
  conformance;
- the local Suite runner executes the locked lifecycle/admission and five P2.0b
  exec case IDs with the `providerapi`, `providerapi/v1`, and
  `provider/admission` test matrices; this remains Provider
  component/Contract-suite evidence, not aggregate lifecycle conformance;
- `suite_digest` is still a locked declared value and is not recomputed from
  Suite contents by the verifier; Git Contract-tree binding protects the
  consumed tree, but content-derived Suite digest remains an independent
  enhancement and is not claimed here;
- no aggregate lifecycle conformance, external-caller E2E,
  multi-controller reliability, multi-tenant safety, deployment readiness, or
  production readiness is claimed.

The local Contract explicitly authorizes the discovery operation's `400` and
parser-visible `501` outcomes, but implementation evidence for those outcomes
still needs to be re-run under the new projection.

## Current Verification

Passed locally (authorized test environment):

- JSON parsing of all newly added Contract resources;
- `git diff --check`;
- `internal/contractlock` unit tests;
- local Provider projection tests for `providerapi/v1` and `providerapi`;
- full `go test -race -shuffle=on -count=1 ./...`;
- `go vet ./...`;
- provider API socket/TLS tests;
- tagged Docker integration.
- P1.2.3 coordinator race/shuffle tests for idempotent accept, deadline
  pre-dispatch, known/unknown runtime outcomes, restart inspection, stale
  generation rejection, event replay, and concurrent reconciliation.
- P2.2b provider exec repository tests for idempotency and digest binding,
  cancellation target/generation binding, independent cancellation fencing, result
  retention and tombstones, immutable snapshots, concurrent memory access,
  file restart/lock/corruption handling, and cancelled contexts;
- P2.2b full race/shuffle test matrix, `go vet`, local Contract lock verifier,
  19-case local Conformance Suite, dependency-boundary check, and `git diff
  --check` passed in the authorized test environment.
- P2.2c focused repository/coordinator race/shuffle tests cover durable
  reservation before dispatch, attach identity and receipt conflicts, replay
  without redispatch, restart/query of unattached records and cancellation
  intents, cancellation confirmation gating, result/cancellation conflicts,
  context failures, deep copies, and file lock/corruption behavior.

Pending:

- P2.3a Contract authority, P2.3b lock/projection, P2.3c application,
  PR, and post-merge evidence;
- optional content-derived Suite digest enhancement;
- aggregate lifecycle conformance, external-caller E2E, reliability, tenancy,
  deployment, and production gates.

## Next Entry

P1.1d is explicitly closed by the local Suite/security matrix, PR #19 CI, and
post-merge run `32365284283`. P1.2.0 is closed by PR #21, its three successful
PR checks, and post-merge run `32368734877`. P1.2.1 is closed by PR #22, its
three successful PR checks, and post-merge run `32370133083`. P1.2.2 is closed
as provider-local persistence only; the file adapter is single-controller
development evidence. P1.2.3 is closed as internal create dispatch and restart
reconciliation. P1.2.4 is closed as a projection/component slice; post-merge
CI run `32435540542` passed all required jobs. PR #26 merged the behavior-bound
Conformance mappings as `4ccb107`; post-merge run `32436541588` passed. PR #27
then composed the independent Provider lifecycle application and merged as
`28076a7`; post-merge run `32439289227` passed. It projects only `POST /v1/sandboxes`, `GET
/v1/sandboxes/{sandbox_id}`, and `GET /v1/operations/{operation_id}` after
protected admission. The command composition root now constructs an independent
Provider lifecycle application when explicitly enabled; disabled and
production-fake configurations remain fail-closed. Reserved
routes remain absent, and aggregate conformance, external-caller E2E,
multi-controller reliability, tenancy, deployment, and production claims
remain unproven. The P1.2.5 local Conformance mappings now exercise
coordinator idempotency, stale generation, concurrent reconciliation, deadlines,
cancellation, unknown outcomes, restart inspection, and locked DTO projection.
Terminate/lease/orphan cleanup are not authorized by the current Contract
revision. P1.2.5 is closed only for the current authorized subset. Terminate,
lease mutation, orphan cleanup, sessions, snapshots, runtime exec behavior,
and aggregate caller compatibility remain unproven or Contract-reserved. PR
#30 closed the bounded exec Contract gate only. P2.1 locally validates an
uncomposed Provider-local execution port with bounded input and opaque receipt
validation. PR #31 and post-merge CI close that local component slice. P2.2a
adds only result/intent domain validation; PR #33 and post-merge CI close that
domain slice. Neither slice exposes an exec route, durably accepts an operation,
retains a result, records cancellation intent in storage, reconciles an
outcome, selects a Docker/backend adapter, or proves runtime execution
behavior.

P2.2b is closed by PR #35 merge `c467cd4`, PR CI `32456100570`, and
post-merge CI `32456279722`. The next entry is P2.2c: define durable
pre-dispatch reservation/attach ordering, bounded coordination, pending
cancellation recovery/query boundaries, and an optional Canceler port. Do not
expose Provider HTTP, Docker/backend selection, or claim aggregate/runtime
execution compatibility from P2.2b.

P2.2c local implementation now provides durable reservation before executor
dispatch, exact opaque receipt attachment, bounded coordinator ordering, and
optional cancellation confirmation. Known non-context executor errors remain a
durable pending reservation rather than an inferred terminal failure; context
or receipt uncertainty is not redispatched on recovery. Cancellation intent
replay does not repeat external side effects, and current recovery exposes
query-only intent state rather than automatic Canceler retry. HTTP, Docker,
lifecycle-repository reuse, aggregate conformance, external E2E,
multi-controller, tenancy, deployment, and production claims remain unproven.

P2.2c is closed by PR #39 merge `17072e6`, PR CI `32460695928`, and post-merge
CI `32460914417`. P2.3a is now the active Contract authority slice. It cannot
enable terminal/session/Gateway runtime behavior until a distinct resource
commit and P2.3b lock/projection gate are accepted.
